# CANBusCommunication_Libraries
Libraries You'll Want to Add for https://github.com/tthomas2000/CanBusCommunication to work properly.

Added in a separate file because they need to be put in a specific arduino file.

1.) Unzip Files
2.) Go to Home >> Arduino >> libraries.
3.) Paste these libraries there.
